        <p class="home-content"> <img class="home-page-image" src="./assets/images/headshot.jpg" /> Hello, My name is David Manly. This is my personal website. I'm creating this website to tell you a little about myself. I hope you enjoy reading about my life and all the things
            I do. As I child I idealized America, it was an unattainable ideal, but it grew into an American dream for me at a very young age. As a 5th generation Liberian I shared that dream with many others across the continent and at the age of 12
            I had the opportunity to move to America. It was surreal but I quickly adapted and begin to pursue all of the things I thought the American dream stood for. By my mid-twenties I had a solid career as a software Analyst and more money than
            I had imagined for that time in my life, but I was without a sense of purpose. The American ideal was now my reality, but it was lacking. I had never planned on going back to Liberia because of what I’d experienced there. The civil war, lack
            of leadership and corruption pushed me to distance myself but in 2014 my mother invited me to visit my last living grandparent. Thankfully, I agreed. As soon as we got close enough to see the tropical rainforest in Liberia the feeling was
            indescribable – freedom, I was home.
